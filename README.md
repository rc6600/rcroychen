Hello! I'm a Chemical/Biomolecular Engineering and Computer Science student at UIUC (graduating Dec 2021).
Deep learning applications for biochemistry interest me, as well as app development.
The Deep Learning class I'm in has taught me how to use PyTorch, as well as knowledge about GANs, CNNs, Gradient Backpropogations, and more.
I'm currently looking for an internship/job for the summer of 2021, and open to fields such as statistics, biology, and of course, computer science.

My latest project is the Statistical 10 Percent Condition Visualizer, where I simulate the effects of sampling with replacement versus without replacement within a population that can be tuned with various parameters, such as size, success rate, and number of samples.
